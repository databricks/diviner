Contributing Guide
====================

We happily welcome contributions to the Diviner package. We use
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/databricks/diviner/issues>`_ to track community
reported issues and `GitHub Pull Requests <https://github.com/databricks/diviner/pulls>`_ for accepting changes.
Contributions are licensed on a license-in/license-out basis.


Communication
-------------

Before starting work on a major feature, please reach out to us via GitHub by filing an issue. We will make sure no one
else is already working on it and ask you to open a GitHub issue. A "major feature" is defined as any change that is
> 100 LOC altered (not including tests), or changes any user-facing behavior, API signature, or introduces a new
wrapped grouped model implementation. We will use the GitHub issue to discuss the feature and come to an agreement on
the design approach and help to answer any questions you may have on implementation details or designs.
The GitHub review process for major features is also important so that organizations with commit access can come to
agreement on design. If it is appropriate to write a design document, the document must be hosted either in the GitHub
tracking issue, or linked to from the issue and hosted in a world-readable location.
Small patches, examples, documentation updates, and bug fixes don't need prior communication and can be submitted as a
PR directly for review.

Coding Style
------------
We follow `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ with one exception: lines can be up to 100 characters in
length, not 79.

Code formatting
---------------

We use the Python formatting plugin `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to ensure that code formatting
throughout this package is consistent. To ensure that any submissions are consistent, ensure that you have installed
the required version in `dev-requirements </dev-requirements.txt>`_. Prior to committing changes to your local branch,
simply run ``black .`` from the root of the repository.
It is also strongly recommended to run pylint prior to commits to minimize the number of requested changes you may see
in a pull request. To install all required code formatting tools, simply run ``pip install -r "dev-requirements.txt"``
from within your containerized development environment to ensure that you have the required versions of all tools.

Sign your work
--------------

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the
patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can
certify the below (from developercertificate.org):

::
