        Grouping key columns must be defined to serve in the construction of a consolidated
        single unique key that is used to identify a particular unique time series. The
        unique combinations of these provided fields define and control the grouping of
        univariate series data in order to train (fit) a particular model upon each of the
        unique series (that are defined by the combination of the values within these supplied
        columns).

        The primary purpose of the children of this class is to generate a dictionary of:
        {<group_key> : <DataFrame with unique univariate series>}.
        The `group_key` element is constructed as a tuple of the values within the columns
        specified by `_group_key_columns` in this class constructor.

        For example, with a normalized data set provided of:
        |ds          |y       |group1    |group2    |
        |2021-09-02  |11.1    |"a"       |"z"       |
        |2021-09-03  |7.33    |"a"       |"z"       |
        |2021-09-02  |31.1    |"b"       |"q"       |
        |2021-09-03  |44.1    |"b"       |"q"       |

        There are two separate univariate series: ("a", "z") and ("b", "q").
        The group generator's function is to convert this 'unioned' DataFrame into the following:

        { ("a", "z"):
                        |ds          |y       |group1    |group2    |
                        |2021-09-02  |11.1    |"a"       |"z"       |
                        |2021-09-03  |7.33    |"a"       |"z"       |
                        ,
          ("b", "q"):
                        |ds          |y       |group1    |group2    |
                        |2021-09-02  |31.1    |"b"       |"q"       |
                        |2021-09-03  |44.1    |"b"       |"q"       |
        }
        This grouping allows for a model to be fit to each of these series in isolation.
